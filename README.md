# Wireless-Data-Transmission-using-LIGHT.-DIY-Li-Fi


ABOUT THIS PROJECT
I wanted to transfer data between two arduinos wirelessly using an unconventional method. I decided to use a LED as a transmitter and receive the data by an LDR. I wrote a simple protocol to allow for reliable data transmission. With minor modifications this project can also be adapted to transfer data using fiber optics. I encourage you to try this and share your implementation!

All you need to do to replicate this project is to setup the circuit as shown in the figure below:
